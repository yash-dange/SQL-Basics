# SQL Basics: MySQL with 'The Office (US)' Database

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the basics of SQL by using a self-created database based on the popular TV show *The Office (US)*. It explores fundamental SQL concepts such as querying, joins, aggregations, and subqueries using real-world-like data.

## Key Skills and Technologies
- **SQL** (MySQL)
- **Database Design:** Created a custom database structure based on the TV show's data.
- **Data Manipulation:** Performed CRUD operations and complex queries to extract insights.
- **CTE, Window Functions, Joins & Subqueries:** Applied inner joins, outer joins, and subqueries for advanced data analysis.

## Project Features
- **Database Setup:** A self-created database containing tables for employees, departments, and episodes.
- **Basic Queries:** Retrieve data using SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY.
- **Aggregation Functions:** Perform calculations using COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX.
